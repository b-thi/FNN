Description: This package fits models of the form y(z, f(x) | theta) = z + f(x) + epsilon. In other words, this package will allow users to build
             models that have either functional or scalar responses paired with functional and scalar covariates. The main backbone of these models is
             neural networks. There are also a number of helper functions that make workflow easier for the user. 
Details: To be updated.
